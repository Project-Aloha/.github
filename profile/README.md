### Q&A
  - Why not store it in [edk2-porting](https://github.com/edk2-porting) ?
    - The owner removed mu-sm8150pkg from edk2-porting because it has edk2-msm, which supports more platforms.
  - Why not put it under personal account ?
    - It should be owned by all the developers contributed to it.
  - What's the meaning of this orgnization ?
    - The repo(s) still needs to be mantained and updated.
